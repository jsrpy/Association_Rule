# Association-Rule

Association Rule is a conventional but important topic in correlation analysis and recommender system.

This serves as an introduction to Association Rules implementing in Python.

Check out the [introduction jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jsrpy/association-rule/blob/master/association_rules_introduction.ipynb).

There are 3 step-by-step illustrated examples. The first 2 are constructed on imaginary customer basket data, whereas the thrid example bases on an open dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

More sophisticated analysis with real datasets will be consistenly developed.
